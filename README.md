# My Financial Pathways: A Personalized, Inclusive Financial Literacy Platform

## Project Overview
**My Financial Pathways** is a digital financial guide designed to empower users from diverse backgrounds to build stronger financial habits. This platform provides personalized, accessible financial literacy tools with an emphasis on equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI). By tailoring financial guidance to each userâ€™s background and financial experience, the platform helps users manage their personal finances in a way that respects their unique circumstances.

## Features
The platform combines four main elements to support comprehensive financial education:

### 1. Budgeting & Expense Management
An interactive tool that helps users:
- Track expenses and set savings goals.
- Receive budgeting suggestions tailored to their financial background, location, and lifestyle.

### 2. Goal-Setting & Financial Habits Builder
A feature to help users:
- Set short-term and long-term financial goals.
- Get culturally relevant guidance that respects spending habits, family obligations, or specific financial needs.
- Explore diverse saving methods (e.g., micro-saving) to suit different income levels.

### 3. Investing Basics & Simulation
An accessible investment guide with a virtual simulation:
- Educates users on stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
- Provides financial knowledge at different levels and in multiple languages to accommodate various backgrounds.

### 4. Debt Management Advice and Repayment Planner
A tool for managing debt:
- Offers tailored suggestions for debt repayment strategies.
- Provides guidance on different repayment methods based on user needs and financial history.

## EDI (Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion) Component

- **Language Options**: Available in multiple languages to serve a broad range of users.
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Designed to be accessible to users with visual impairments.
- **Culturally Sensitive Guidance**: Offers advice that respects unique financial practices, including support for those with nontraditional income sources, like gig workers or small business owners.
